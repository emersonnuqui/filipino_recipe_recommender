Mix well. Set aside.
Arrange the chicken in a large bowl. Pour-in the chicken barbecue marinade. Make sure that all the chicken slices are coated with the marinade. Cover the bowl with a cling wrap. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour (the longer, the better).
Heat-up your grill (around 320F). If you are using a charcoal grill, limit the charcoal in the two sides leaving an opening on the middle. If you are using a gas grill, only activate all the burner except the one in the middle (I am referring to the grill burners, not the one on the side, if your grill has one).
Skewer at least 2 chicken slices in bamboo or metal skewers. Arrange the chicken in the middle of the grill wherein there is no direct heat in the bottom. The heat should be coming from the sides. This will take sometime to cook the chicken, but it prevents the skin from burning.
Cover the grill (if applicable), and barbecue the chicken for 12 to 15 minutes.
Turn the chicken over to barbecue the other side. Baste the top of the chicken with the basting sauce. Barbecue for another 12 to 15 minutes.
Flip the chicken once more and baste the top part. Continue to barbecue for 12 to 15 minutes.
Turn the chicken over for the last time and brush some basting sauce on the top part. Continue to barbecue for 12 to 15 minutes.
Using a meat thermometer, measure the internal temperature of the chicken. A safe temperature for poultry is 165F. If the temperature of your chicken barbecue is 160F and above, this means you are done; otherwise, continue to barbecue the chicken until the desired internal temperature is achieved.
